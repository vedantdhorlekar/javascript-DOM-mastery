    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents, while the DOM tree is the specific, logical, hierarchical structure used by the browser to represent that document. JavaScript uses the DOM API to interact with and dynamically change the content, structure, and style of a web page in real-time. 
The DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM is not a programming language itself, but a web API that gives JavaScript the power to manipulate web pages. When a browser loads an HTML document, it creates the DOM in the computer's memory. Every part of the document, such as elements, text, and comments, is converted into a structured set of objects that JavaScript can access and manipulate. 
Key characteristics of the DOM:
API: It provides methods and properties (the interface) for programs to change the document's structure, style, and content.
Object-Oriented: The entire web page is represented as a collection of objects.
Dynamic: Changes made to the DOM using JavaScript are immediately reflected on the web page.

    The DOM Tree
The DOM tree is the visual, hierarchical representation of the document's structure, much like a family tree. 
Nodes: Everything in the DOM tree is called a node. The main types you will encounter are element nodes (HTML tags), text nodes (the content inside tags), and comment nodes.
Hierarchy: Nodes have relationships to each other:
Root: The top node in an HTML document is the document object, which contains the <html> element node.
Parent: A node that has other nodes inside it (e.g., <body> is the parent of a <h1> tag).
Child: A node directly inside a parent node (e.g., <head> and <body> are children of <html>).
Sibling: Nodes at the same level with the same parent
